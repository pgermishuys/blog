It's been quite some time since I have written anything.

I initially started my blog in 2005, to share my adventure in game development. After I gave up on my dreams to become a professional game developer, I drifted away from the game development scene to focus my efforts on a career in professional software development and then life got in the way.

Since then, I had the opportunity to work on a [great OSS project](http://eventstore.org) full time, had a lot of fun and then moved to the Netherlands to work with a great group of people at eVision Industry Software.

I want to start writing again as I want to put down on "paper" if you will, my learnings in Golang as well as me possibly getting back into game development.
