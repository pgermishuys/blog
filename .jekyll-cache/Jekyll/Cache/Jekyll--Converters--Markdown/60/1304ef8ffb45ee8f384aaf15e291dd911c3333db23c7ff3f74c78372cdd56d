<p>It’s been quite some time since I have written anything.</p>

<p>I initially started my blog in 2005, to share my adventure in game development. After I gave up on my dreams to become a professional game developer, I drifted away from the game development scene to focus my efforts on a career in professional software development and then life got in the way.</p>

<p>Since then, I had the opportunity to work on a <a href="http://eventstore.org">great OSS project</a> full time, had a lot of fun and then moved to the Netherlands to work with a great group of people at eVision Industry Software.</p>

<p>I want to start writing again as I want to put down on “paper” if you will, my learnings in Golang as well as me possibly getting back into game development.</p>
