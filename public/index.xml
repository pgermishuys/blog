      <description>It&#39;s been quite some time since I have written anything.
I initially started my blog in 2005, to share my adventure in game development. After I gave up on my dreams to become a professional game developer, I drifted away from the game development scene to focus my efforts on a career in professional software development and then life got in the way.
Since then, I had the opportunity to work on a great OSS project full time, had a lot of fun and then moved to the Netherlands to work with a great group of people at eVision Industry Software.</description>
